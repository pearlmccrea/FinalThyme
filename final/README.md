For the final assignment I chose to do a combined final with my cataloging class and the web development final assignment. My cataloging class also required a creative final, so I decided to merge the two into one finished product. I designed a website to host images of the cook book covers I cataloged.

I wanted this website to have multiple functions, rather than just hosting the bibliographic data I cataloged. Each “card” with the book image has a link that links to the World Cat record so a user can find available copies at their local library. In addition there is a link that links to the original cataloging I did for this assignment. Included in the website are the other projects I did this quarter as well as a searchable feature that allows the user to search for a recipe within the cookbooks. When a recipe is searched it retrieves the book title and page number where that recipe can be found. As this information had to be manually input, I did not do it for all six books, but rather chose to do a sampling of three to show how this feature would function.

Given more time and knowledge I would like to find a more attractive and searchable way of displaying the bibliographic data (the cataloged records). I would also gussy up my resume rather than just linking out to the PDF.

Overall I found this class very challenging, but am quite satisfied with the end result and feel it does a good job of showcasing all of the skills I learned this quarter.
