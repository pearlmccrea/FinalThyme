# Managing Your Files Challenge
## **Pearl McCrea**
### Masters of Library and Information Science candidate
I have lived in Seattle, WA since 2010 and grew up in Washington.
__*The Name of the Wind*__ by Patrick Rothfuss is my favorite book, I enjoy knitting and **cross country skiing**.
This class is completely out of my comfort zone, I think it's a useful skill to have so I am challenging myself.
