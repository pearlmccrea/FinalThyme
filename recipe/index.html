      <h1>Homemade Ricotta</h1>
        <h2>In Your Instant Pot</h2>
        <p>by Pearl McCrea</p>
        <p>Simple homemade ricotta for use in your everyday recipes.</p>
        <p><em>Serves 4-6 people</em></p>
       
        
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk">8 Cups whole milk</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon#Culinary_uses">1/3 Cup fresh lemon juice,</a> or <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid"> 3/4 teaspoon citric acid</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt">1/4 Teaspoon salt </a>(optional)</li></ul>


   <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the milk into the Instant Pot and cover with the lid with vent valve set to open. Select the YOGURT function and adjust until the digital display reads BOIL. When the cooking time is up, remove the lid.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice or citric acid and stir gently a few times. Stirring too vigorously will yield a less pleasant texture and break apart the curds. Stir until the milk coagulates and forms curds. There will be separation between bright white chunks of curd and thin yellowish liquid whey. This will take about 30 seconds. Stop stirring and let the mixture stand for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line a colander with cheesecloth or a clean, thin cotton towel and set it over a large bowl. Carefully pour the cheese and whey into the colander.</li>
            <li>For moist, creamy ricotta, let the cheese drain for 5 minutes. For firmer ricotta, allow the cheese to drain for up to 4 hours at room temperature. When the cheese is done draining, stir in the salt (if using).</li>
            <li>Transfer the cheese to an airtight container and refrigerate. The ricotta can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
        </ol>
